Camp Placement Script

Dependency

https://github.com/riversafe33/uiprompt

This script allows you to create camps in the game, with the option to place chests and use them to store items. 
Each chest can only be opened by the person who placed it. It includes a command to activate the target system to remove placed objects, 
as these are saved in the SQL database, allowing you to set up camps that will remain even after the server restarts. 
Itâ€™s fully configurable, letting you add as many props as you want in the config.lua.
